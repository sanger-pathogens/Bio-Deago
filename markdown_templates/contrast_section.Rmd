## {$contrast_name}

#### MA plot
The MA plot below compares the mean of the normalized counts against the log fold change, showing one point per gene.  Points will be colored red if the adjusted p-value is less than 0.05. Points which fall out of the window are plotted as open triangles pointing either up or down.
```\{r {$contrast_name}.MA, results='asis'\}
plotContrastMA(contrasts$'{$contrast_name}', resultsDir, geneLabels=TRUE)
```

#### Volcano plot
The volcano plot below compares the mean of the normalized counts against the log fold change, showing one point per gene.  Points will be colored where the p-value is less than 0.05. Green points represent down-regulated genes (log2FoldChange < -2) and orange points represent up-regulated genes (log2FoldChange > 2).
```\{r {$contrast_name}.volcano, results='asis'\}
plotVolcano(contrasts$'{$contrast_name}', resultsDir, geneLabels=TRUE)
```

### Differential expression
The table below contains differntially expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.01, log2 fold change <= 2 | >= 2)
```\{r {$contrast_name}.DEA, results='asis'\}
prepareContrastTable(contrasts$'{$contrast_name}')
```
