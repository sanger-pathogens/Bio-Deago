# QC plots
## Reads per sample
This reads per sample plot shows the total read counts for each sample. Bar colours represent experimental condition.
```\{r countPlot, fig.width={$rc_fig_width}, fig.height={$rc_fig_height}\}
plotReadCounts(dds, resultsDir)
```

## Sample-to-sample distances
The sample-to-sample distance plot gives an overview of how the samples cluster based on their euclidean distance using the regularized log transformed count data.
```\{r plotSampleDistances, results="hide", fig.keep="all", warnings = FALSE, fig.width={$sd_fig_width}, fig.height={$sd_fig_height}\}
plotSampleDistances(dds, resultsDir)
```

##PCA plot
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot shows the first two principal components which explain the variability in the data using the regularized log count data.
```\{r pcaPlot, warning=FALSE, fig.width={$pca_fig_width}, fig.height={$pca_fig_height}\}
pcaPlot(dds,resultsDir)
```

##Cook's distances
Cook's distance is a measure of how much a single sample is influencing the fitted coefficients for a gene. A large value of Cook's distance is intended to indicate an outlier count. 
```\{r plotCooks, results="hide", fig.keep="all", warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE, fig.width={$cd_fig_width}, fig.height={$cd_fig_height}\}
plotCooks(dds,resultsDir)
```

##Density plot
The density plot shows the distribution of normalised read counts per sample.
```\{r plotDensity, results="hide", fig.keep="all", comment=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width={$dens_fig_width}, fig.height={$dens_fig_height}\}
plotDensity(dds,resultsDir)
```

##Dispersion plot
The dispersion estimate plot shows the gene-wise estimates (black), fitted values (red) and final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue).
```\{r plotDispersionEstimates, results="hide", fig.keep="all", warning = FALSE, fig.width={$disp_fig_width}, fig.height={$disp_fig_height}\}
plotDispersionEstimates(dds, resultsDir)
```
