### GO term enrichment - {$go_level} (all DE genes)
The table below contains a list of the top 20 significant GO terms identified by the weight01 method and their associated p-values for all significantly differentially expressed genes (q < 0.05). 
```\{r {$contrast_name}.{$go_level}, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'\}
prepareGOtable(go_tables$'{$contrast_name}_{$go_level}')
```

### GO term enrichment - {$go_level} (upregulated genes only)
The table below contains a list of the top 20 significant GO terms identified by the weight01 method and their associated p-values for all significantly upregulated genes (q < 0.05, log2foldChange > 0).
```\{r {$contrast_name}.{$go_level}.up, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'\}
prepareGOtable(go_tables$'{$contrast_name}_{$go_level}_up')
```

### GO term enrichment - {$go_level} (downregulated genes only)
The table below contains a list of the top 20 significant GO terms identified by the weight01 method and their associated p-values for all significantly downregulated genes (q < 0.05, log2foldChange < 0).
```\{r {$contrast_name}.{$go_level}.down, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'\}
prepareGOtable(go_tables$'{$contrast_name}_{$go_level}_down')
```
