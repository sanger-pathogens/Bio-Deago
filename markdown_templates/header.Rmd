# Introduction

This report was generated by the WTSI Pathogen Informatics Differential Expression Pipeline. It should only be used as an overview of your RNA-Seq data and is not intended to be a final analysis.

The R package [DEAGO](https://github.com/vaofford/deago) is a wrapper which contains functions to generate QC plots, perform differential expression analysis with [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) and GO term enrichment analysis with [topGO](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html).

The [Pipeline configuration](#Pipeline configuration) section below gives the details of the files and settings used to generate this report.  These have been imported from {$config_filename}.

```\{r setup_libraries, include=FALSE\}
