# Introduction

This is an HTML report generated by the WTSI Pathogen Informatics Differential Expression Pipeline. Please use only as an overview of your RNA-Seq data as this is not intended to be a final analysis.

The R package [DEAGO](https://github.com/vaofford/deago) is a wrapper which contains functions to generate QC plots, perform differential expression analysis with [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) and GO term enrichment analysis with [topGO](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html).

The [Pipeline configuration](##Pipeline configuration) section below gives the details of the files and settings used to generate this report.  These have been imported from {$config_filename}.

## Pipeline configuration 
```{r config, message=FALSE}
parameters <- importConfig({$config_filename})
